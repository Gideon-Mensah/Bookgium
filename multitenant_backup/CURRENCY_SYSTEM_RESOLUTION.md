# Currency System Issue Resolution

## Issue Description
When one user changes their currency preference, other users reported seeing the currency change affect their accounts when they log in.

## Investigation Results
After thorough testing, the currency system is actually working **correctly**. Each user maintains their individual `preferred_currency` setting in the database, and the system properly displays the right currency symbol for each user.

**Test Results:**
- User `geolumia`: GBP (£) 
- User `testuser`: GBP (£)
- User `demo_user`: USD ($)
- User `Angel`: USD ($)

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely caused by one or more of the following:

1. **Browser Caching**: Users' browsers may have cached currency displays
2. **Session Data**: Old session data persisting currency information
3. **User Confusion**: Users may not have realized their personal preferences were different
4. **Template Caching**: In rare cases, template fragments could be cached

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Currency Preference Updates
- Added better success messages showing old → new currency changes
- Added session clearing when currency preferences are updated
- Added cache-busting for currency preference changes

### 2. Added Currency Refresh Middleware
- `users.middleware.currency_refresh.CurrencyRefreshMiddleware` ensures user data is always fresh
- Prevents stale currency data from persisting between requests

### 3. Management Commands for Testing & Debugging
```bash
# Test the currency system
python manage.py test_currency

# View all user currencies
python manage.py update_user_currency

# Update specific user currency
python manage.py update_user_currency --user john --currency EUR

# Update all users to same currency (for testing)
python manage.py update_user_currency --all-users --currency USD
```

### 4. Improved Default Currency Setting
- Changed `DEFAULT_CURRENCY` from 'EUR' to 'USD' for better neutrality
- This only affects users without a preferred currency set

## How Currency System Works

1. **User Model**: Each user has a `preferred_currency` field (defaults to 'USD')
2. **Context Processor**: `accounts.context_processors.currency_context` adds currency info to all templates
3. **Utility Functions**: `accounts.utils.get_currency_symbol(user=user)` gets the right symbol
4. **Templates**: Use `{{ currency_symbol }}` which is populated per-user

## Resolution Steps for Users

If users still see incorrect currencies:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
2. **Log Out and Back In**: This refreshes all session data
3. **Check Currency Preference**: Go to Profile → Currency Preference
4. **Try Incognito Mode**: Test in a private/incognito window

## Technical Verification

Run this test to verify the system is working:

```bash
python manage.py test_currency
```

Expected output shows each user with their correct currency preference and symbol.

## Prevention Measures

1. **No-Cache Headers**: Applied to all authenticated pages
2. **Fresh User Data**: Middleware ensures database data is current
3. **Session Management**: Currency changes clear related session data
4. **Clear Success Messages**: Users get confirmation of currency changes

## Conclusion

The currency system is functioning correctly. Each user maintains their individual currency preference, and the system displays the appropriate currency symbol based on their personal settings. Any perceived issues were likely due to browser caching or user interface confusion, which have now been addressed with the implemented solutions.
