## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- [ ] A GitHub/GitLab repository with your code
- [ ] All necessary files created (requirements.txt, Procfile, etc.)
- [ ] A Render account (free tier available)
- [ ] Basic understanding of environment variables
- [ ] Your application tested locally

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Preparing Your Application

### Step 1: Files Already Created

I've created the following essential files for your deployment:

1. **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
2. **`Procfile`** - Tells Render how to run your app
3. **`build.sh`** - Automated build script
4. **`runtime.txt`** - Python version specification
5. **`bookgium/production_settings.py`** - Production configuration
6. **`.env.example`** - Environment variables template

### Step 2: Update Your Settings

You need to update your main settings file to use production settings on Render:

```python
# Add this to the end of bookgium/settings.py
import os
if 'RENDER' in os.environ:
    from .production_settings import *
```

### Step 3: Make Build Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

### Step 4: Create Static Files Directory

```bash
mkdir static
mkdir staticfiles
```

## üîê Environment Variables Configuration

### Step 1: Set Required Environment Variables

In your web service settings, go to "Environment" tab and add:

**Essential Variables:**
```
RENDER=True
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@hostname:port/database
```

**Optional Variables (recommended):**
```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Step 2: Generate Secret Key

Use Python to generate a secure secret key:

```python
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())
```

## ‚ö° Post-Deployment Tasks

### Step 1: Wait for Initial Deployment

- Monitor the deployment logs
- Initial deployment takes 5-10 minutes
- Watch for any errors in the build process

### Step 2: Create Superuser Account

After successful deployment, create an admin user:

1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click on "Shell" tab
3. Run: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
4. Follow the prompts to create your admin account

### Step 3: Initialize Application Data

```bash
# Initialize audit settings
python manage.py init_audit_settings

# Load any initial data (if you have fixtures)
python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json
```

---

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Step 1: Basic Functionality Test

1. Visit your Render app URL (e.g., `https://bookgium-app.onrender.com`)
2. Test user registration and login
3. Try creating accounts, transactions, and journal entries
4. Test the different user roles (admin, accountant, HR, viewer)

### Step 2: Database Operations Test

1. Create test data through the admin interface
2. Verify data persistence across sessions
3. Test the audit logging functionality
4. Check that currency preferences work correctly

### Step 3: Static Files Test

1. Verify CSS and JavaScript files load correctly
2. Check that images and media files work
3. Test file uploads in the application

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails

**Symptoms:** Build process stops with errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check your requirements.txt format
# Ensure all dependencies are listed
# Verify Python version compatibility
```

### Issue 2: Database Connection Errors

**Symptoms:** 500 errors, database connection failures

**Solutions:**
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Check database is running and accessible
- Ensure database migrations ran successfully

### Issue 3: Static Files Not Loading

**Solutions:**
- Verify STATIC_ROOT setting
- Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
- Check WhiteNoise configuration

### Issue 4: Secret Key Errors

## üîÑ Maintenance and Updates

### Deploying Updates

1. **Push to Repository:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update application"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Automatic Deployment:**
   - Render automatically deploys when you push to main branch
   - Monitor deployment logs for any issues

3. **Manual Deployment:**
   - Go to your service dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

### Database Migrations

For new migrations:
1. Migrations run automatically during build process
2. Monitor logs to ensure they complete successfully
3. For complex migrations, consider maintenance mode

### Monitoring

- **Logs**: Check service logs regularly
- **Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, and response times
- **Uptime**: Set up monitoring alerts
- **Database**: Monitor database performance and storage

   - Optimize slow queries
   - Regular database maintenance

2. **Caching:**
   - Add Redis for session caching
   - Cache expensive database queries
   - Use Django's caching framework

3. **Static Files:**
   - WhiteNoise handles static files efficiently
   - Consider CDN for better performance
   - Compress images and assets

### Backup Strategy

1. **Database Backups:**
   - Render provides automatic backups
   - Consider additional backup solutions
   - Test restore procedures
